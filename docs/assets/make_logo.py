"""YANI logo: a sibling of the YAMC mark, with capture instead of a track.

YAMC shows a particle traversing the letters, which is what a transport code
does. yani transmutes, so the motif is a full reaction: a neutron arrives from
the left and is absorbed into a large nuclide sitting on the seam between "A"
and "N", the colour boundary the wordmark already has. The compound nuclide
splits into an alpha particle, which drops away below it, and a recoiling
daughter, which is what emits the gamma continuing on through "N" and "I".
Letters keep their normal kerning -- the motif is sized to read clearly at
letter height, which means it rides over the top of "A" and "N" the way
YAMC's own track rides over its letters, rather than being shrunk to fit the
sliver of whitespace between them. Bound nucleons are drawn in their own
physical colours, blue neutrons and red protons, rather than the green used
for a neutron in flight; that green, and the letters' blue and orange, are
sampled from the YAMC png.
