"""Type-check the Python examples in the prose docs against yani-core's stubs.

The API reference is generated from the installed wheel, so a renamed or
retyped member shows up there on its own. The hand-written examples on the
other pages do not: they are prose, and prose keeps compiling. yani-core 0.11.0
changed ``Material.transmute()`` from returning ``list[Material]`` to returning
``TransmutationResults``, which has no ``__getitem__``, and every
``results[-1]`` in these pages -- the README's first example among them -- went
on rendering perfectly while raising TypeError for anyone who typed it in.

So the examples are extracted and run past mypy against the ``.pyi`` stubs the
wheel ships. This is a type check, not an execution: it needs no nuclear data
and no solve, which is what makes it cheap enough to sit in the docs job. It
catches the class of breakage above -- indexing what is not indexable, calling
what is gone, passing what no longer fits -- and it catches none of the physics.

Each page is concatenated into one module in source order, because that is how
the page reads: a name bound in one block is used in a later one. Pages that
open on a name they never bind get it from PLACEHOLDERS below.

Run: python docs/check_examples.py [--keep]
